betterFORM lightSteelBlue (Version 3.0)
-------------------------------------------------------
betterFORM lightSteelBlue is a full W3C XForms 1.1 implementation which has intensively  been tested against
the XForms 1.1 Test Suite and reaches between 95 and 98% conformance level. It uses the Dojo toolkit as
its client platform to provide attractive controls and layout features.

Further betterFORM lightSteelBlue supports XPath 2, dynamic subforms, is easy to install and has a much improved
documentation. The XFormsFeatureExplorer serves as a live reference of the supported features and complements
the PDF documenation.

betterFORM is tested against a test suite of about 560 unit tests and more than 400 feature tests which have been
run on Firefox 3.0 + 3.6, IE 7, Chrome 4+5 and Safari 4.

Chrome, Firefox and Safari work equally well. IE 6 support has been dropped and IE 7 might still have some detail issues.
The forms also run on iPhone 3G, 3GS but have not been optimized for those yet.
