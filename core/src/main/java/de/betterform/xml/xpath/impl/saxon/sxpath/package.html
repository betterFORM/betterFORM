<title>Package overview for net.sf.saxon.sxpath</title>
</head>

<body>

<p>This package provides an alternative API for executing XPath expressions
directly from a Java application: unlike the API in package <code>net.sf.saxon.xpath</code>, these
interfaces are not dependent on JAXP 1.3. The API can be used either in a free-standing
Java application (that is, where there is no XSLT stylesheet), or it can be
used from within Java extension functions called from XPath expressions within
a stylesheet.</p>

<p>If you have JDK 1.5 installed, you should probably be using the standard XPath API defined
in JAXP 1.3, which is available in package <code>net.sf.saxon.xpath</code>, distributed in a
separate JAR file <code>saxon8-xpath.jar</code>. This interface is provided for use it situations
where installing JAXP 1.3 is inconvenient. It provides less functionality than the JAXP API, for
example it does not allow XPath expressions to reference variables or functions, and it gives no
control over the result type of the expression (you can control this by including casts or
conversion functions within the expression itself).</p>

<p>The method <code>XPathEvaluator.build(Source)</code> is probably the most convenient way of
building a Saxon tree, and can be used quite independently of the XPath API.</p>
