Release Notes
=============
betterForm version 1.5.2
-------------------
1.5.2 fixes some issues with Localisation, toggling of nested cases and resolution of binding expressions inside of
Submission elements. It adds the new Xforms 1.1 schema which is now configurable. Therefore the nil value is now
valid for a bunch of Schema types like data, double and the like.

Localisation has been improved and now falls back to US locale as default if incoming value cannot be parsed. A new
appender has been added to logging.

betterForm version 1.5.1
-------------------
Submission class now correctly extends BindingElement which fixes a bug with actions in submits.

betterForm version 1.5.0
-------------------
Main focus for this release was the migration of the XPath engine from JXPath to Saxon. Along this way most of the
functions defined by XForms 1.1 have been implemented. The source tree of the project has been completely refactored
and uses an Ant build process again. Maven builds are an optional addon when certain tools are desired.

betterForm version 1.4.0
-------------------
This is a maintainance release with fixes a lot of detail issues plus adds some new XForms 1.1 features here and there.
Most noteable is the migration to Maven 2 as a build tool to improve the build organisation of the rather grown
ant files. This is intended to ease the integration of betterForm in several different scenarios and provide up-to-date
versions of betterForm Core in our Maven repository.

betterForm version 1.3.0
-------------------
Countless fixes and corrections according to XForms 1.0 (Second Edition) have been made. The overall package structure
has been refactored a great deal for clarity. More than a dozen bugs have been fixed - some of them being serious ones.
But also a lot of improvements have been made: the Preprocessor has been removed for efficiency, some new XPath
functions have been introduced and a new StylesheetCache is in place. A more detailed change list can be found
 as always in changes.txt.

betterForm version 1.2.0
-------------------
Contains corrections to fix the vast majority of the XForms errata and moves betterForm to XForms 1.0 Second Edition.
Important areas of the source have been refactored for simplification and some performance improvements (100% in some areas). 
Many new tests have been introduced to ensure the new behaviour and some of the long-standing bugs have been fixed.

betterForm version 1.1.1
-------------------
This release mainly established the new modularization and changed build and distribution strategy. BetterForm
now only contains the core XForms implementation along with all generic resources needed/usefull for any
XForms processing environment either client- or serverside. Main changes therefore are related to the build-file.

The BetterFormAdapter interface has been refactored to condense some of the experiences with the different integrations.
Though, this process is still not complete.

betterForm version 1.1.0
-------------------
The betterForm distribution has been splitted into core and integration modules. This means that the core
XForms processor will be distributed as a separate download from now on. Integrations modules such as
BetterForm-servlet, Chicoon and Convex will include betterForm as a jar-file. Files and tools relevant for multiple
modules will be kept in the core and exported to the different modules when necessary. 

Some of the unavoidable bugs of a 1.0.0 version have been fixed as well as some new features have been added (which
justify the 0.2 instead of a 0.1).  

betterForm version 1.0.0
-------------------
This is the first production-qualitiy release of BetterForm. A lot of detail-work has been made on the
core, improving overall stability and efficiency as well as exception-handling. Another
few gaps to full spec conformance have been closed, e.g. XForms 1.0 Extension Functions now
also provide the missing date functions.

Known Issues:
There are still things defined in XForms 1.0 that betterForm does not support. A detailed conformance
