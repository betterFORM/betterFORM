Known Issues
============

betterForm version 1.2.0
-------------------

- In rare cases (e.g. when a setvalue is triggered during a refresh) the deferred update behaviour might not work
correctly resulting in parts of the UI not being refreshed.

- XML Schema loading does not use betterForm Connector classes and only 'http' and 'file' are supported through Xerces
directly.

- The Upload control requires both 'filename' and 'mediatype' child elements to be present. The binding behaviour in
this case is not correct cause binding to non-existing instance nodes from 'filename' or 'mediatype' element results
in an exception. The overall binding implementation for upload must be aligned with other controls and is scheduled
for refactoring.

- Usage of default namespaces in instance data is not supported yet. XPath expressions and Instance data must use
identical prefixes.
