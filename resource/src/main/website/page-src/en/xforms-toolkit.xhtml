                                The XForms Toolkit adds an abstraction layer to your web application development and lifts
                                it to the next productivity level.

                                The descriptive and generic approach
                                avoids repetitive scripting lowers the cost for development and changes.
                                You get running applications within days.

                                The betterFORM engine turns XForms into state-of-the-art Web 2.0 applications which can be
                                consumed by every major desktop or mobile browser. With a rich set of styling options you
                                can tailor the look&amp;feel to exactly match the guidelines
                                of your CI.

                                XForms-driven applications allow to very easily aggregate various data sources
                                into one view and to act upon that data. A generic set of actions allows data- as well as
                                user interface manipulation without writing a single line of script code.

                                The XForms Toolkit easily integrates with your existing infrastructure and offers
                                extension points for plugging custom logic. It plays well with ReST, SOAP, XMLRPC and HTTP
                                making it an ideal partner in SOA and EAI.
